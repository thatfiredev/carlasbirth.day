            According to Urban Dictionary:

            <blockquote class="italic text-black bg-gray-100 mx-2 my-2">
                <p class="px-4 py-4">
                    Is an extraordinary person inside and out, will go above and beyond for people even when they don’t deserve. Is someone you can always count on even when times get tough. You can tell them anything. You really need a Carla in your life because not only will your life be overjoyed with a girlfriend or friend like Carla but you’ll also have endless laughs no matter what the situation is.
                </p>
            </blockquote>

            Or even better:
            <blockquote class="italic text-black bg-gray-100 mx-2 my-2">
                <p class="px-4 py-4">
                    A amazing friend that will care for you even if u hurt her many times. Carla is a heartbroken soul that just wants to be loved. Carla is very pretty even though she denies it. You can ask her for almost anything and she will try to help even if it gets her in trouble. Carla has been through a lot so plz don't stress her out. She may seem tough around people but when she gets home she is a very broke down emotional mess. Besides that she is a real keeper she will never switch up on you.

            Oh, this is the most accurate definition:

            <blockquote class="italic text-black bg-gray-100 mx-2 my-2">
                <p class="px-4 py-4">
                    Cute
                </p>
